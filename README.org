** Introduction

   This is my Emacs configuration, a somewhat simple config compared
   to most. It's geared towards OS X, although it should work on most
   *nix configs. I've never tried this on Windows, so YMMV.

   This configuration aims to provide you with a bare-bones
   configuration with sane defaults, built upon =package.el=.

   Although Emacs has support for many programming languages, this
   config is geared towards the following languages and workflows:

- Emacs Lisp
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Clojure

** Installation

   To install, it's recommended to clone this repo wherever you prefer
   and symlink the directory to =~/.emacs.d=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotemacs.git
   #+END_SRC

   There is a =Makefile= provided that will create the symlink for you at
   =~/.emacs.d=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ make setup
   #+END_SRC

   My current Emacs distro of choice is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
   $ brew install emacs-head@28 --with-cocoa --with-imagemagick --with-retro-icon-gnu-head
   #+END_SRC

   Please note, this requires [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]] to be installed.

** Requirements

   There are a few requirements needed for this config to properly run.
   All of these pre-requisites can be installed via =homebrew= and =npm=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ brew install gpg
   $ brew install ag
   $ brew install ripgrep
   $ brew install node
   $ npm install -g eslint
   $ npm install -g bash-language-server
   #+END_SRC

   For using =python-mode= and =elpy=, you'll need to have =pip=
   installed and install the following packages:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ pip install flake8
   #+END_SRC

** Package Updates

   To update the third-party packages, type @@html:<kbd>@@M-x
   list-packages@@html:</kbd>@@, then @@html:<kbd>@@U@@html:</kbd>@@
   followed by @@html:<kbd>@@x@@html:</kbd>@@.

   I recently started to use @Malabarba's excellent [[https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/][paradox]], which can be
   invoked similarly as such - @@html:<kbd>@@M-x
   paradox-list-packages@@html:</kbd>@@, then
   @@html:<kbd>@@U@@html:</kbd>@@ followed by
   @@html:<kbd>@@x@@html:</kbd>@@.

** Email

There are a few requirements needed to receive and send email with this config.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install isync
$ brew install msmtp
$ brew install notmuch
#+END_SRC
