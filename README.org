** Introduction

   This is my Emacs configuration, a somewhat simple config compared
   to most. The setup and installation is geared towards macOS,
   although it should work on most *nix configs. I also run this same
   config on Fedora with no issues. I've never tried this on Windows,
   so YMMV.

   This configuration aims to provide you with a bare-bones
   configuration with sane defaults, built upon =use-package=.

   Although Emacs has support for many programming languages, this
   config is geared towards the following languages and workflows:

- Emacs Lisp
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Go

  As part of my constant tweaking and rewrites, I created a dedicated
  terminal-only `init.el` found in `./terminal/init.el` that is meant
  to be the absolute minimum carried over from my main config.

** Installation

   To install, it's recommended to clone this repo wherever you prefer
   and symlink the directory to =~/.emacs.d=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotemacs.git
   #+END_SRC

   There is a =Makefile= provided that will create the symlink for you at
   =~/.emacs.d=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ make setup
   #+END_SRC

   My current Emacs distro of choice is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
   $ brew install emacs-head@30 --with-cocoa --with-imagemagick --with-liquid-glass
   #+END_SRC

   Please note, this requires [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]] to be installed.

** Requirements

   There are a few requirements needed for this config to properly run.
   All of these pre-requisites can be installed via =homebrew= and =npm=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ brew install gh
   $ brew install ripgrep
   $ brew install node
   $ npm install -g eslint
   #+END_SRC
